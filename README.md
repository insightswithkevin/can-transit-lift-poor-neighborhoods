# Can Transit Lift Poor Neighborhoods?  
### A Quasi-Experimental Evaluation of the E Line Expansion in Los Angeles

## 📌 Overview

My bachelor thesis investigates the **socioeconomic effects** of the **E Line (Expo Line) expansion** on **low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles County**. Combining **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** with **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)**, it explores whether improved transit access leads to measurable improvements in neighborhood-level economic outcomes.

## 🧠 Motivation

The relationship between **urban segregation** and **socioeconomic inequality** has become a key focus in urban sociology. While public transit is widely believed to enhance access to labor markets, its **long-term impacts on disadvantaged communities** remain underexplored.

This project challenges the common assumption that **transit expansion inherently improves** the socioeconomic status of low-income areas.

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Design**: Quasi-experimental  
- **Approach**:  
  - Difference-in-Differences (DiD)  
  - Propensity Score Matching (PSM)  
- **Data**:  
  - American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates  
  - Geographic levels: **Census Tracts** and **Block Groups**

## 📊 Key Variables

**Dependent Variables (outcomes):**
- Log median household income  
- Share of low-income households  

**Exploratory Mechanisms:**
- Unemployment rate  
- Influx of high-income households  

## 🔍 Main Findings

- No statistically significant treatment effects were found for the core outcome variables.
- Improved transit accessibility **alone** does not necessarily translate into socioeconomic uplift for poor neighborhoods.
- Results suggest the influence of **unobserved factors** such as:
  - Neighborhood-specific **social capital**
  - **Local institutions and networks**
  - **Job quality** and labor market segmentation
